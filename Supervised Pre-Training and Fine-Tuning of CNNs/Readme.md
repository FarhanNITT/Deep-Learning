# Supervised Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning of CNNs on Fashion MNIST

This repository demonstrates the application of supervised pre-training and fine-tuning techniques on the Fashion MNIST dataset, following the methodology outlined in [PyTorch's Transfer Learning Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). The project explores two strategies for transfer learning: fine-tuning the entire model and training only the final classification layer.

Test accuracy for case 1 (Fine tuning the entire model ) : 91.68% <br>
Test accuracy for case 1 (Training the final classification layer ) : 89.45%
