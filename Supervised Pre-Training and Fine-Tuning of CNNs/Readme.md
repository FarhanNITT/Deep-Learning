# Supervised Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning of CNNs on Fashion MNIST

This repository demonstrates the application of supervised pre-training and fine-tuning techniques on the Fashion MNIST dataset, following the methodology outlined in PyTorch's Transfer Learning Tutorial. The project explores two strategies for transfer learning: fine-tuning the entire model and training only the final classification layer.
